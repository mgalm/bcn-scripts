BlueCat Usersscripts

Update: Addon
===============

To not let this get out of hand I decide to move the scripts into a browser Addon which let's you select the scripts you want to have runnning.
Feel free to check this out instead, I don't know how activate the scripts here will be worked on and updated in the future.

Getting started
===============

First you need to install either one of these user-script add-ons for your browser (I personally prefer Chrome):

* <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> for Firefox
* <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptish/">Scriptish</a> for Firefox
* <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en-US">Tampermonkey</a> for Chrome

Tampermonkey is available for a varitiy of browsers. More information <a href="https://tampermonkey.net/">here @ tampermonkey.net</a>
The list includes Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera Next, and Firefox. Also Dolphin Browser & UC Browser according to the website.

To install (also my) scripts the following FAQ can help: https://tampermonkey.net/faq.php?ext=dhdg#Q102

Install a script
================

After you've installed an add-on of your choice:
* Select the script you want to install
* Click the RAW button and the add-on should pick up the handling from there
